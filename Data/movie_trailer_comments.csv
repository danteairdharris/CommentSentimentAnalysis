It‚Äôs definitely a unique film compared to the first two, but it still stays fresh and intriguing. The case and storyline is different from the first two and it takes us on Ed and Lorraine‚Äôs most complex, most dangerous, and sinister case yet. It still has those familiar Conjuring vibes that we all love, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were absolutely phenomenal yet again, there‚Äôs plenty of scares and creepy scenes, it‚Äôs very atmospheric, and has the darkest villain yet (The Occultist). The film takes us to places we haven‚Äôt been before and delves into Satanic Worship, curses, murder, witchcraft, and the dark side of spirituality. Lorraine‚Äôs clairvoyance is explored more than ever, the murder case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson is very interesting, and there‚Äôs lots of heartfelt and touching moments. Especially between Ed and Lorraine. I loved the flashback scenes of when they were young and this film shows how they first met. Lots of suspenseful moments, the characters are interesting, and the tone of good overcoming evil is very powerful. The film‚Äôs true crime/supernatural plot is a very unique mix.
