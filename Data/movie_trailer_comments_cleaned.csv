It still has those familiar Conjuring vibes that we all love, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were absolutely phenomenal yet again, there‚Äôs plenty of scares and creepy scenes, it‚Äôs very atmospheric, and has the darkest villain yet (The Occultist). The film takes us to places we haven‚Äôt been before and delves into Satanic Worship, curses, murder, witchcraft, and the dark side of spirituality. Lorraine‚Äôs clairvoyance is explored more than ever, the murder case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson is very interesting, and there‚Äôs lots of heartfelt and touching moments. Especially between Ed and Lorraine. I loved the flashback scenes of when they were young and this film shows how they first met.
